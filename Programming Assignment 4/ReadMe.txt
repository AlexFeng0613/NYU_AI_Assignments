This program contains 5 java classes: the Main.java where the program proceeds, Snippet.java and Cluster.java which defines the attributes and actions of each snippet and cluster, one stemmer.java class which is used to create stemmed form words and one ComparatorByAlphabet.java class that used for sort the cluster list.

In addition to these classes there is also a stop words text file used for discarding key stop words. I have also put the inputPage.html in this program, though you can choose where the input and output file locates and their path and name.

To run this program compile all java classes is required: for each class file,javac classname.java. When all classes are complied then type: java Main. The program will begins running with instructions about which step this program is running now and the input and output page file name and path.

Having finished typing input and output file you'll see the result as professor's output page shows. Where do the output page locate depends on your previous outrage path and filename input.

That's the whole introduction for this program. Thanks for compiling and grading!
