This assignment is written in java.

For the input there is no need to manually input the task information: ID, value, time requirement, and prerequisite. All is created by the random function.

Every experienment the program will print out the task list, including the id, value, time requirement and its succeeding tasks. For the convenience of task calling I do not define the prerequisite list, but I use the succeeding list as an instead.

There are 6 classes in this assignment. stateSpaceSearch is where the main function locates. To compile this code all classes must be in the same package. 

Class task defines one task, with the properties. 

Class State is task list with value, time and the succeeding list that can be add to the state so that turn to another state.

Queue is the basic abstract data structure as its name.

Class StateResult is the result after one IDF algorithms, storing information such as the solution list, the total value, total time, whether is a right solution and the states created during this process.

ExperienmentResult works as a recorder of one experienment, using for counting the max and min states number, and the fraction that have solutions.
